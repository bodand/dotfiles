=head1 NAME

 dotfiles - bodand's dotfiles

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 ./install.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

My dotfile repository with and installer. Different operating systems are (will be)
supported, and different themes are (may be) available for installation. 

The repository contains installable artifacts as-is, even if some of them may be
automatically generated from some other using the F<build.ninja> file in each
theme's directory; this, however, is only relevant on the system creating 
the configuration.

=head2 Prerequisites

The requirement is Perl 5 and the following packages installable through cpan:

=head2 Installation

The installation is easy if the prerequisites are met: 

 doas ./install.pl

Replace B<doas> with B<sudo> if you still use that.

For different options see B<./install -??> and for more documentation about 
its behavior see B<./install -???>.

=head2 Directory layout

The directory layout may be confusing for some, or future me after forgetting
how this thing worked: the followings describe which directory contains what.

The F<os/> directory contains the different packages and files required to get
going on different operating systems. They install things that are to be used
in everyday workflow, unrelated to the theme. 

The F<theme/> directory contains one subdirectory for the theme that may be 
installed. 
Each theme contains the different dotfiles that may be used to get the system
to use the wanted style.
